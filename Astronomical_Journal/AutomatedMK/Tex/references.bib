abstract="In this paper a new technique is developed on stellar spectral classification. Because stellar spectral data sets are usually extremely noisy, wavelet de-noising method is proposed to reduce noise first. Then the support vector machines (SVM) is used for the classification. Experimental results show that in most cases, there will be a better performance using this composite classifier than using SVM with principle component analysis data dimension reduction technique.",

  abstract={This paper describes an expert computer program (MKCLASS) designed to classify stellar spectra on the MK Spectral Classification system in a way similar to humans—by direct comparison with the MK classification standards. Like an expert human classifier, the program first comes up with a rough spectral type, and then refines that spectral type by direct comparison with MK standards drawn from a standards library. A number of spectral peculiarities, including barium stars, Ap and Am stars, λ Bootis stars, carbon-rich giants, etc., can be detected and classified by the program. The program also evaluates the quality of the delivered spectral type. The program currently is capable of classifying spectra in the violet-green region in either the rectified or flux-calibrated format, although the accuracy of the flux calibration is not important. We report on tests of MKCLASS on spectra classified by human classifiers; those tests suggest that over the entire HR diagram, MKCLASS will classify in the temperature dimension with a precision of 0.6 spectral subclass, and in the luminosity dimension with a precision of about one half of a luminosity class. These results compare well with human classifiers.}

  abstract={We present a solution to the long-standing problem of automatically classifying stellar spectra of all temperature and luminosity classes with the accuracy shown by expert human classifiers. We use the 15 Å resolution near-infrared spectral classification system described by Torres-Dodgen & Weaver in 1993. Using the spectrum with no manual intervention except wavelength registration, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can classify these spectra with Morgan-Keenan types with an accuracy comparable to that obtained by human experts using 2 Å resolution blue spectra, which is about 0.5 types (subclasses) in temperature and about 0.25 classes in luminosity. Accurate temperature classification requires a hierarchy of ANNs, while luminosity classification is most successful with a single ANN. We propose an architecture for a fully automatic classification system.}

In total, we used 29 182 spectra of stars falling in the effective temperature range between 10000 and 5500 K, including white dwarfs. The targets were selected on the basis of SDSS colours. We compare our results not only with the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline output, but also with already published values and find excellent agreement. With new and extensive data sets from all-sky ground based as well as satellite missions, our approach will become very important and efficient to analyse these information (© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

We firstly perform spectral line matching to determine redshift candidates for an observed spectrum, and then estimate the spectral class by measuring the similarity between the observed spectrum and the shifted templates for each redshift candidate. As a byproduct of this approach, the spectral redshift can also be obtained with high accuracy. Compared with some approaches based on computerized learning methods in the literature, the proposed approach needs no training, which is time-consuming and sensitive to selection of the training set. Both simulated data and observed spectra are used to test the approach; the results show that the proposed method is efficient, and it can achieve a correct classification rate as high as 92.9%, 97.9% and 98.8% for stars, galaxies and quasars, respectively.}
