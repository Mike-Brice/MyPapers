\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

The results shown in this paper support that accurate automatic stellar classification can be obtained using domain specific feature selection. Compared to previous work of other authors, there are three interesting conclusions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A high level of accuracy can be obtained by considering only flux measurements at wavelengths near the $H_\delta$ and Ca \RomanNumeralCaps{1} absorption lines.
	\item A complete MK classification can be identified using a single classifier with a high level of accuracy.
	\item Aside from flux scaling, any additional spectrum pre-processing after the processes presented by \citeauthor{Dawson} and \citeauthor{Stoughton} is unnecessary. 
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, this new approach for the automatic classification of stellar spectra is feasible, useful, and accurate.
