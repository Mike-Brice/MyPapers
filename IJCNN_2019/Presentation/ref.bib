  abstract={We present a solution to the long-standing problem of automatically classifying stellar spectra of all temperature and luminosity classes with the accuracy shown by expert human classifiers. We use the 15 Å resolution near-infrared spectral classification system described by Torres-Dodgen & Weaver in 1993. Using the spectrum with no manual intervention except wavelength registration, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can classify these spectra with Morgan-Keenan types with an accuracy comparable to that obtained by human experts using 2 Å resolution blue spectra, which is about 0.5 types (subclasses) in temperature and about 0.25 classes in luminosity. Accurate temperature classification requires a hierarchy of ANNs, while luminosity classification is most successful with a single ANN. We propose an architecture for a fully automatic classification system.}

  abstract={This paper describes an expert computer program (MKCLASS) designed to classify stellar spectra on the MK Spectral Classification system in a way similar to humans—by direct comparison with the MK classification standards. Like an expert human classifier, the program first comes up with a rough spectral type, and then refines that spectral type by direct comparison with MK standards drawn from a standards library. A number of spectral peculiarities, including barium stars, Ap and Am stars, λ Bootis stars, carbon-rich 
giants, etc., can be detected and classified by the program. The program also evaluates the quality of the delivered spectral type. The program currently is capable of classifying spectra in the violet-green region in either the rectified or flux-calibrated format, although the accuracy of the flux calibration is not important. We report on tests of MKCLASS on spectra classified by human classifiers; those tests suggest that over the entire HR diagram, MKCLASS will classify in the temperature dimension with a precision of 0.6 spectral subclass, and in the luminosity dimension with a precision of about one half of a luminosity class. These results compare well with human classifiers.}

  abstract={Large spectroscopic surveys require automated methods of analysis. This paper explores the use of k -means clustering as a tool for automated unsupervised classification of massive stellar spectral catalogs. The classification criteria are defined by the data and the algorithm, with no prior physical framework. We work with a representative set of stellar spectra associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) SEGUE and SEGUE-2 programs, which consists of 173,390 spectra from 3800 to 9200 Å sampled on 3849 wavelengths. We classify the original spectra as well as the spectra with the continuum removed. The second set only contains spectral lines, and it is less dependent on uncertainties of the flux calibration. The classification of the spectra with continuum renders 16 major classes. Roughly speaking, stars are split according to their colors, with enough finesse to distinguish dwarfs from giants of the same effective temperature, but with difficulties to separate stars with different metallicities. There are classes corresponding to particular MK types, intrinsically blue stars, dust-reddened, stellar systems, and also classes collecting faulty spectra. Overall, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the classes we derive and the MK types. The classification of spectra without continuum renders 13 classes, the color separation is not so sharp, but it distinguishes stars of the same effective temperature and different metallicities. Some classes thus obtained present a fairly small range of physical parameters (200 K in effective temperature, 0.25 dex in surface gravity, and 0.35 dex in metallicity), so that th
e classification can be used to estimate the main physical parameters of some stars at a minimum computational cost. We also analyze the outliers of the classification. Most of them turn out to be failures of the reduction pipeline, but there are also high redshift QSOs, multiple stellar systems, dust-reddened stars, galaxies, and, finally, odd spectra whose nature we have not deciphered. The template spectra representative of the classes are publicly available in the online journal and at ftp://stars:kmeans@ftp.iac.es.}

abstract="Classification is one of the important tasks in astronomy, especially in spectra analysis. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a typical classification method, which is widely used in spectra classification. Although it performs well in practice, its classification accuracies can not be greatly improved because of two limitations. One is it does not take the distribution of the classes into consideration. The other is it is sensitive to noise. In order to solve the above problems, inspired by the maximization of the Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and the SVM separability constraints, fuzzy minimum within-class support vector machine (FMWSVM) is proposed in this paper. In FMWSVM, the distribution of the classes is reflected by the within-class scatter in FDA and the fuzzy membership function is introduced to decrease the influence of the noise. The comparative experiments with SVM on the SDSS datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier FMWSVM.",

  abstract={We study 16,707 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (an early version of the First Data Release; DR1) using the Karhunen-Loève transform (or principal components analysis). The redshifts of these quasars range from 0.08 to 5.41, the i -band absolute magnitudes from -30 to -22, and the resulting rest-frame wavelengths from 900 to 8000 Å. The quasar eigenspectra of the full catalog reveal the following: first order—the mean spectrum; second order—a host-galaxy component; third order—the UV-optical continuum slope; fourth order—the correlations of Balmer emission lines. These four eigenspectra account for 82% of the total sample variance. Broad absorption features are found not to be confined in one particular order but to span a number of higher orders. We find that the spectral classification of quasars is redshift and luminosity dependent; as such there does not exist a compact set (i.e., less than ≈10 modes) of eigenspectra (covering 900–8000 Å) that can describe most variations (i.e., greater than ≈95%) of the entire catalog. We therefore construct several sets of eigenspectra in different redshift and luminosity bins. From these eigenspectra we find that quasar spectra can be classified (by the first two eigenspectra) into a sequence that is defined by a simple progression in the steepness of the slope of the continuum. We also find a dependence on redshift and luminosity in the eigencoefficients. The dominant redshift effect is a result of the evolution of the blended Fe II emission (optical) and the Balmer continuum (the "small bump," λ rest ≈ 2000–4000 Å). A luminosity dependence is also present in the eigencoefficients and is related to the Baldwin effect—the decrease of the equivalent width of an emission line with luminosity, which is detected in Lyα, Si IV +O IV ], C IV , He II , C III ] and Mg II , while the effect in N V seems to be redshift dependent. If we restrict ourselves to the rest-wavelength regions 1150–2000 Å and 4000–5500 Å, the eigenspectra constructed from the wavelength-selected SDSS spectra are found to agree with the principal components by Francis et al. and the well-known "Eigenvector-1" of Boroson & Green, respectively. ASCII formatted tables of the eigenspectra are available.}

  abstract={Using the k-means cluster analysis algorithm, we carry out an unsupervised classification of all galaxy spectra in the seventh and final Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release (SDSS/DR7). Except for the shift to rest-frame wavelengths and the normalization to the g -band flux, no manipulation is applied to the original spectra. The algorithm guarantees that galaxies with similar spectra belong to the same class. We find that 99% of the galaxies can be assigned to only 17 major classes, with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining 1%. The classification is not unique since many galaxies appear in between classes; however, our rendering of the algorithm overcomes this weakness with a tool to identify borderline galaxies. Each class is characterized by a template spectrum, which is the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class. These low-noise template spectra vary smoothly and continuously along a sequence labeled from 0 to 27, from the reddest class to the bluest class. Our Automatic Spectroscopic K-means-based (ASK) classification separates galaxies in colors, with classes characteristic of the red sequence, the blue cloud, as well as the green valley. When red sequence galaxies and green valley galaxies present emission lines, they are characteristic of active galactic nucleus activity. Blue galaxy classes have emission lines corresponding to star formation regions. We find the expected correlation between spectroscopic class and Hubble type, but this relationship exhibits a high intrinsic scatter. Several potential uses of the ASK classification are identified and sketched, including fast determination of physical properties by interpolation, classes as templates in redshift determinations, and target selection in follow-up works (we find classes of Seyfert galaxies, green valley galaxies, as well as a significant number of outliers). The ASK classification is publicly accessible through various Web sites.}
