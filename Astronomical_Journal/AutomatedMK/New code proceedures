RV > 200 km/s and RV < 200 km/s

Proceedures

Take dataset and transform into two arrays of Z < 0.00066 and Z >= 0.00066

Divide both arrays into 10 folds.

For each validation:
	Take one fold from each array to use as the two test sets. 
	Take the remainding folds and combine to form the train set.
	Build Model
	Test RV > 200 km/s and store both times, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score in result array 1
	Test RV < 200 km/s and store both times, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score in result array 2
	Repeat for all 10 cross validations

Report scores and make tables.
