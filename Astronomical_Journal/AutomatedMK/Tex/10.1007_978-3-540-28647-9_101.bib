abstract="In this paper a new technique is developed on stellar spectral classification. Because stellar spectral data sets are usually extremely noisy, wavelet de-noising method is proposed to reduce noise first. Then the support vector machines (SVM) is used for the classification. Experimental results show that in most cases, there will be a better performance using this composite classifier than using SVM with principle component analysis data dimension reduction technique.",
